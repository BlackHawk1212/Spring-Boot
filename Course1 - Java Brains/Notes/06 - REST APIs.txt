* RETS API is usually deal with knows as entities or resources we have to identify that first
  in order to establish the contract for your REST API.
 
* Resources are the things in your domain so in the case of a course API topic there is a resource

* Once you identified the resources you can then look at the reason which the consumers can access
  the resource using the different HTTP methods.

* In our API we are going to identify three seperate resources we have:
	> Topic
	> Course
	> Lesson

* We have bunch of ways in which you access these resources either to get it or update it.

* Those ways are influenced by the method you are using for accessing them. So the HTTP method influences
  what you do with these resources but the resource itself is are the constants right there are the
  entities in your system.


Topics:
